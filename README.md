# calender

This application hosts a workday calender with the purpose of scheduling events.

The calender is time sensitive. It alerts the user of the current day/time as well as color-coded alerts within the calender to specify the time of events.

This application has not been completed to it's entirety.

The calender has yet to have the ability to save events that are inserted into the text input section.
